# Connect. Contact. Conduct.

Springboot application to bring together consumer and service provider.
Consumer is anyone who needs a service (plumbing, electric repairs, etc).
Service provider is anyone who wants to provide the service in return of a payment (plumber, electrician)

### Working Mechanism

	- Service is conducted and post is closed
