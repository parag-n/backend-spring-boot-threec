Discussion outcome on December 6, 2022

-> discussed about the functional requirements of the project
-> there will be two types of users of the application: 1) Service provider 2) Consumer
-> the Consumer will be able to access the following features -
    = ability to create an account, log into it.
    = when a service is required, they will create a post about it
    = following fields will be mandatory to be provided while posting -
         - category and type of service
         - date
         - time
         - location
    = in addition to the above fields, user can also add images to help 
      the service providers identify the problem or the work.
      This way the service provider will be able to bid accordingly and prepare beforehand.
    = give ratings and reviews about the service they were provided with.
    
-> the Service provider will be able to access the following features
    = ability to create an account, log into it.
    = provide details about the expertise they have about any particular category 
    (e.g. Electrician will be listing his certificates and work experience)
    = see the posts added by the consumers
    = bid on any of the posts which fall under their category
    = ability to cancel the appointment if something comes up unannounced
      (this should be done before a predefined cancellation period,
      for example, 1 day before or 8 hours before the date of service delivery)

There might be some things we discussed in the meeting but got missed in the above logs.
Let's build on this in the next meeting.
